```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rmarkdown)
```

The purpose of this R markdown file is to experiment with a variety of GeoSpatial use cases. For this analysis, I will be taking a look at the geospatial data associated with India's population. 
Let's started by importing the data. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```
```{r}
library(sf)
my_sf = st_read("india_states_2014/india_states.shp")
```

```{r}
library(GADMTools)
india_wrapper = gadm_sf.loadCountries("IND", level = 1, basefile = "./")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo= true}
my_spdf = as(my_sf, "Spatial")
class(my_spdf)
```



```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
str(my_spdf, max.level = 2)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
